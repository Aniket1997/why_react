Why React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive web applications by handling the complexities of DOM manipulation and updating.

ðŸŒŸ Key Concept
Without React (HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript):
When using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you need to:

Manually capture DOM elements.
Write logic to update those elements whenever the data changes.

Problem:

Manual DOM Manipulation: You have to find and update the DOM elements manually.
Complexity Increases: As the app grows, this becomes harder to manage, debug, and scale.

âœ… With React
React takes care of:

Automatically updating the DOM when the state changes.
Efficiently re-rendering only the parts of the UI that need updating.

ðŸš€ Advantages of React:
State-Driven UI Updates:
React uses a concept called state to track data. When the state changes, React automatically updates the UI.
No Manual DOM Manipulation:
You don't need to manually find or update elementsâ€”React handles it behind the scenes.
Reusability:
React components are modular and reusable, making it easier to organize code.
Performance:
React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI, minimizing expensive DOM operations.
